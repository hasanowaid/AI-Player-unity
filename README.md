# AI-Player-unity
play with AI computer that helped me to improve my game on unity, now a player can practice with AIPlayer

IDK which I write here, but I'm new here on github, all I want to use or learn more about github and I wish that will help me to improve my experience in game developement.
I made that simple project gameplayAI to help the players on my game to practice or test my game before challenge other player.
